```

This feature currently is still experimental, please contact shangzhi.pan@go1.com for further information if you want to use it.

## Live Editing
### Setup
- Clone both repos. This assumes they are in the same directory
- install dependencies of both in their repos via yarn or npm
- in GO1D repo run `npm run npm:dev`
- in another tab run inside content loader folder `npm link ../GO1D/build` (On Windows you might need to stop yarn in GO1D Repo, you also have to relink every time you used npm to add or update a package)
- inside content loader run `npm start`

### Starting
- in GO1D repo run `npm run npm:dev`
- inside content loader run `yarn start`

## Contribute
Components should be documented in docs/components with at least:
* A one or two line description of the component with it’s use case
* Major use cases of the component
* It’s current development status & release version

Component should have at least one story with all props in the "stories" folder. You can find a tutorial on how to add stories for storybook [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react/).
